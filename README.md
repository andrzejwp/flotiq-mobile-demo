Then start building your own app, based on the Flotiq Mobile Expo.

## SETUP

- To prepare your development environment follow the official React Native guide. This project was created with RN CLI.
  Read more in the [React Native CLI Quickstart](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup).

### Android Studio
- We recommend to install Android Studio through the excellent JetBrains Toolbox.

    `https://www.jetbrains.com/toolbox-app/`

### Xcode
- The app has been successfuly built with Xcode 11.4.

### React-Native - PROJECT
(`nodejs` is must.)

- Clone this repository
    
    `git clone https://github.com/flotiq/flotiq-mobile-demo`
    
and run:

    `npm install`

- Turn on the simulator:
   - Android - follow [documentation](https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/dev-options) for instructions, 
   - iOS - follow [documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/running_your_app_in_the_simulator_or_on_a_device) for instructions.
   
- Run project:

    `npx react-native run-android`
    `npx react-native run-ios`

    Sometimes there is an issue with starting `metro` server. In separate window run it manually:

    `npx react-native start`

- You can also start the project directly from Android Studio or Xcode.

## COMMON ISSUES
- Android

    If there is an error during the build try to use:

    `cd android && ./gradlew clean`

    or

    `sh android/gradlew clean`

- iOS

    In RN >0.60 version remember to run (within iOS folder):

    `pod install`

    or for update libraries:

    `pod update`
